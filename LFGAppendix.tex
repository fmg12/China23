\begin{itemize}
\item
Single crystals from (Y/Lu)Fe$_2$Ge$_2$ substitution series
\item
$\chi$ shows strongest $T$-dependence where $T_N \rightarrow 0$.
\item
Much weaker $T$-dependence at other compositions suggests low-$T$ tail in $\chi$ is intrinsic, not caused by magnetic impurities.

\begin{itemize}
\item First observation of quantum oscillations in LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$.
\item Very different Fermi surface compared to YFe$_2$Ge$_2$.
\item Reconstructed by SDW order, but not yet understood.
